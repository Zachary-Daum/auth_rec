Identifying patients at high risk of mortality may potentially help to triage clinical management. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate risk factors associated with mortality of patients who received HSCT and admitted to ICU using pediatric sequential organ failure assessment (pSOFA), one of pediatric severity scoring systems in intensive care unit (ICU).</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label="Methods" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">We performed retrospective review of electronic medical records of pediatric patients who received HSCT and were admitted to ICU in our institution between January 2010 and June 2018. Incidence of mortality was obtained, and risk factors associated with the mortality were examined using univariate and multivariable analyses.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label="Results" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The mortality rate of pediatric HSCT patients who were admitted to ICU as a whole was 27.9%. Patients were divided into three groups based on the number of HSCT required and timing of ICU admission. Patients who received first HSCT and admitted to ICU during the same hospital stay were the majority of the study population (Group A). d(pSOFA), which was defined as the difference between maximum pSOFA and admission pSOFA, greater than and equal to 7 best predicted mortality of Group A (the area under the ROC curve 0.850; 95% CI: 0.733-0.966). Univariate and multivariable analyses showed that an increase in neurologic and cardiovascular sub scores were independently associated with higher mortality (odds ratio (OR) 2.27; 95% CI: 1.32-3.93, and OR 2.69; 95% CI: 1.21-5.99, respectively).</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label="Discussion" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">In our single center study, pediatric HSCT patients who were admitted to ICU demonstrated a high mortality. Risk factor analysis demonstrated that patients with the progression of neurologic and cardiovascular injuries probed by pSOFA scoring system during their ICU stay were strongly associated with mortality.</AbstractText>\n            </Abstract>\n            <AuthorList CompleteYN="Y">\n                <Author ValidYN="Y">\n                    <LastName>Kwon</LastName>\n
