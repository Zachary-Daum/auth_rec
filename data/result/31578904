In the chronic care model, self-management support is an essential element. Because of the episodic nature of severe mental illness (SMI) and its high relapse rates, we assume that the extent of self-management support needs of individuals with an SMI is considerable. However, a clear overview of the nature of the self-management support needs of persons with SMI is missing. <b>OBJECTIVE:</b> This study aimed to identify self-management support needs from the perspective of individuals with SMI. <b>METHOD:</b> A systematic review was conducted using the method of thematic synthesis of qualitative studies. After searching the databases MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and EMBASE, we screened the papers for the eligibility criteria: individuals with an SMI, adequately representing the voice of persons with SMI and describing their self-management support needs. Thirty-one papers were included. <b>RESULTS:</b> The main findings showed that participants in the studies described the need for informational support, emotional support, acknowledgment, encouragement, and guidance to make sense of their illness experiences, ease suffering, obtain validation and recognition, execute self-management tasks, and be led through unfamiliar territory. <b>CONCLUSION:</b> The perspectives of persons with SMI can provide a road map for constructing a self-management support intervention for persons with SMI. Important others have an essential role in fulfilling support needs. Independently managing an SMI is difficult. Therefore, it is preferable to let important others participate in self-management interventions and to introduce peer support.</AbstractText>\n            </Abstract>\n            <AuthorList CompleteYN="Y">\n                <Author ValidYN="Y">\n                    <LastName>Beentjes</LastName>\n                    <ForeName>Titus A A</ForeName>\n                    <Initials>TAA</Initials>\n                    <Identifier Source="ORCID">https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5645-1068</Identifier>\n                    <AffiliationInfo>\n                        <Affiliation>Titus A.
