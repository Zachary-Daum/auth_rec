The posterolateral corner-locked (PLCL) technique may be a new method. This study aims to assess the applicability of this technique in a Chinese population. Forty normal Chinese volunteers were recruited and underwent computed tomography (CT) of the lower limbs. Knee model reconstructions and simulated standard tibial osteotomy were conducted digitally. The transepicondylar axis (TEA), the Akagi line, and the line connecting the medial third of the tibial tubercle with the midpoint of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) were projected to the tibial cross-section and marked. The PLCL technique was applied using either symmetrical or asymmetrical tibial tray templates, and the anteroposterior (AP) axis of the tibial tray was marked. The angles between the TEA and these lines were calculated, and the statistical differences were analyzed. The angle between the TEA and the Akagi line and between the TEA and the line connecting the medial third of the tibial tubercle with the midpoint of the PCL were 96.90\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x895.57 and 107.31\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x895.95 degrees, respectively. The angles between the TEA and the AP axis of the symmetrical and the asymmetrical design tibial trays were 94.01\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x894.21 and 96.65\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x894.70 degrees, respectively. Except for the Akagi line and AP axis of the asymmetrical tibial tray, statistical differences were found between all lines (<i>p</i>\xe2\x80\x89&lt;\xe2\x80\x890.05). The PLCL technique is principally suitable for Chinese patients requiring TKA when using the tibial component referred to in this study, although it may result in slight external rotation.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Thieme Medical Publishers 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.</CopyrightInformation>\n            </Abstract>\n
