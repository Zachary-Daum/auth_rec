There is no recommendation in current urological and andrological guidelines in various countries on the diagnosis and treatment of such patients. The first experience of successful surgical treatment of a patient with recurrent varicocele due to May-Thurner syndrome is presented in this paper. The patient had a severe form of the disease and admitted with the varicocele recurrence after 5 previous intervention with chronic pelvic pain syndrome, erectile dysfunction, chronic calculous prostatitis and varicose veins of the pelvic organs. The patient underwent balloon angioplasty and stenting of the left iliac vein on 28th March, 2017 in the City hospital named after E.O. Mukhin. There was almost complete resolution of pelvic pain in the immediate postoperative period (within 1 hour). One week after surgery the patient noted a recovery of erection without any therapy. Three months later, a 45% reduction in the maximum diameter of the prostatic veins was noted according to transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) as well as a lack of antegrade blood flow according to the color Doppler TRUS at rest and during Valsalva\'s test. There was no deterioration of symptoms during follow-up. Overall, the venous blood flow in prostate was decreased which accompanied by the reducing in pain syndrome and restoration of sexual function without medical therapy. The reduction of diameter of testicular and epididymal varicose veins was seen 6 months after surgery. The diameter of veins of pampiniform plexus in supine position at rest was less than 2 mm. There was no retrograde flow neither in supine, nor in stand position during Valsalva maneuver. Thus, X-ray endovascular angioplasty and stenting of the iliac veins in case of arterio-venous crossing at the lower level is a pathogenetically justified and highly effective treatment of varicocele and varicose veins of the pelvic organs in men.</AbstractText>\n            </Abstract>\n            <AuthorList CompleteYN="Y">\n                <Author ValidYN="Y">\n                    <LastName>Kapto</LastName>\n                    <ForeName>A A</ForeName>\n                    <Initials>AA</Initials>\n                    <AffiliationInfo>\n                        <Affiliation>Department of Urology of Autonomic Non-commercial organization of Postgraduate education Educational Center for medical practitioners.</Affiliation>\n                    </AffiliationInfo>\n                    <AffiliationInfo>\n                        <Affiliation>Department of Urology with course of Oncology, Radiology and Andrology of Postgraduate Faculty of the Peoples\' Friendship University of Russia, Moscow, Russia.</Affiliation>\n                    </AffiliationInfo>\n                    <AffiliationInfo>\n                        <Affiliation>Center of Andrology of multidisciplinary medical holding SM-Klinika, Moscow, Russia.</Affiliation>\n                    </AffiliationInfo>\n                    <AffiliationInfo>\n                        <Affiliation>Department of Urology and Operative Nephrology with a course of oncourology of Peoples\' Friendship University of Russia, Moscow, Russia, 5 GBUZ City Clinical Hospital named after E.O.
