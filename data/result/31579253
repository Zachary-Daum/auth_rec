The quality of prescribing practices of physicians, PAs, and NPs was investigated through a serial cross-sectional analysis of the 2006-2012 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS). Ambulatory care services in physician offices, hospital EDs, and outpatient departments were evaluated using a nationally representative sample of patient visits to physicians, PAs, and NPs. Main outcome measures were 13 validated outpatient quality indicators focused on pharmacologic management of chronic diseases and appropriate medication use. The study sampled 701,499 patient visits during the study period, representing about 8.3 billion visits nationwide. Physicians were the primary provider for 96.8% of all outpatient visits examined; PAs and NPs each accounted for 1.6% of these visits. The proportion of eligible visits in which quality standards were met ranged from 34.1% (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor use for patients with heart failure) to 89.5% (avoidance of inappropriate medications in older adults). The median overall performance across all indicators was 58.7%. On unadjusted analyses, differences in quality of care between PAs, NPs, and physicians for each indicator did not consistently favor one practitioner type over others. After adjustment for potentially confounding patient and provider characteristics, the quality of prescribing by PAs and NPs was similar to the care delivered by physicians for 10 of the 13 indicators evaluated, and no consistent directional association was found between provider type and indicator fulfillment for the remaining measures. Although significant shortfalls exist in the quality of ambulatory prescribing across all practitioner types, the quality of care delivered by PAs, NPs, and physicians was generally comparable.<sup>1</sup>.</AbstractText>\n            </Abstract>\n            <AuthorList CompleteYN="Y">\n                <Author ValidYN="Y">\n                    <LastName>Lau</LastName>\n                    <ForeName>Denys T</ForeName>\n                    <Initials>DT</Initials>\n                    <AffiliationInfo>\n                        <Affiliation>Division of Health Care Statistics at the National Center for Health Statistics, Hyattsville, MD.</Affiliation>\n                    </AffiliationInfo>\n                </Author>\n            </AuthorList>\n            <Language>eng</Language>\n            <PublicationTypeList>\n                <PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType>\n                <PublicationType UI="D016420">Comment</PublicationType>\n            </PublicationTypeList>\n        </Article>\n        <MedlineJournalInfo>\n            <Country>United States</Country>\n            <MedlineTA>JAAPA</MedlineTA>\n            <NlmUniqueID>9513102</NlmUniqueID>\n            <ISSNLinking>0893-7400</ISSNLinking>\n        </MedlineJournalInfo>\n        <CitationSubset>T</CitationSubset>\n        <CommentsCorrectionsList>\n            <CommentsCorrections RefType="CommentOn">\n                <RefSource>Pharmacotherapy. 2018 Apr;38(4):417-427</RefSource>\n                <PMID Version="1">29457258</PMID>\n            </CommentsCorrections>\n        </CommentsCorrectionsList>\n        <MeshHeadingList>\n            <MeshHeading>\n                <DescriptorName UI="D000368" MajorTopicYN="N">Aged</DescriptorName>\n            </MeshHeading>\n            <MeshHeading>\n                <DescriptorName UI="D000553" MajorTopicYN="N">Ambulatory Care</DescriptorName>\n            </MeshHeading>\n            <MeshHeading>\n                <DescriptorName UI="D003430" MajorTopicYN="N">Cross-Sectional Studies</DescriptorName>\n            </MeshHeading>\n            <MeshHeading>\n                <DescriptorName UI="D019538" MajorTopicYN="N">Health Care Surveys</DescriptorName>\n            </MeshHeading>\n            <MeshHeading>\n                <DescriptorName UI="D006801" MajorTopicYN="N">Humans</DescriptorName>\n            </MeshHeading>\n            <MeshHeading>\n                <DescriptorName UI="D009722" MajorTopicYN="Y">Nurse Practitioners</DescriptorName>\n            </MeshHeading>\n            <MeshHeading>\n                <DescriptorName UI="D010823" MajorTopicYN="Y">Physician Assistants</DescriptorName>\n            </MeshHeading>\n            <MeshHeading>\n                <DescriptorName UI="D010820" MajorTopicYN="Y">Physicians</DescriptorName>\n            </MeshHeading>\n            <MeshHeading>\n                <DescriptorName UI="D014481" MajorTopicYN="N" Type="Geographic">United States</DescriptorName>\n            </MeshHeading>\n        </MeshHeadingList>\n        <CoiStatement>The Division administers NAMCS and NHAMCS as part of the National Health Care Surveys.
