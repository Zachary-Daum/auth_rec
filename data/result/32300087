Recreational water reservoirs are a potential reservoir of pathogenic fungi. The aim of the study was to assess the diversity of mycobiota in selected artificial bathing reservoirs with regard to its biosafety for the human population. The studies were conducted during the summer of 2016 in three research seasons (June (I), July and August (II), and September (III)), taking into account the various periods of recreational activities. Filamentous fungi were isolated from water samples collected at five different ponds utilized for recreation. From 162 water samples, 149 fungal taxa of filamentous fungi were identified: 140 were classified to species level and only nine to genus level. Aspergillus fumigatus was the dominant species. The highest species richness (S) was noted in June, with 93 fungal taxa (Menhinick\'s index from 2.65 to 4.49). Additionally, in season I, the highest diversity of fungal species was revealed (Simpson\'s diversity index from 0.83 to 0.99). The average number of CFU/1 mL sample ranged between 0.4 and 4.6 depending on the time of sampling and ponds. Of all the isolated species, 128 were clinically relevant (11 from RG-2 and 117 from RG-1), highlighting the need to introduce seasonal mycological monitoring of such reservoirs.</AbstractText>\n            </Abstract>\n            <AuthorList CompleteYN="Y">\n                <Author ValidYN="Y">\n                    <LastName>G\xc3\xb3ralska</LastName>\n                    <ForeName>Katarzyna</ForeName>\n                    <Initials>K</Initials>\n                    <AffiliationInfo>\n                        <Affiliation>Department of Biology and Parasitology Medical University of Lodz, Pomorska 251, 92-213 Lodz, Poland E-mail: katarzyna.goralska@umed.lodz.pl.</Affiliation>\n                    </AffiliationInfo>\n                </Author>\n                <Author ValidYN="Y">\n                    <LastName>B\xc5\x82aszkowska</LastName>\n                    <ForeName>Joanna</ForeName>\n                    <Initials>J</Initials>\n                    <AffiliationInfo>\n                        <Affiliation>Department of Biology and Parasitology Medical University of Lodz, Pomorska 251, 92-213 Lodz, Poland E-mail: katarzyna.goralska@umed.lodz.pl.</Affiliation>\n                    </AffiliationInfo>\n                </Author>\n                <Author ValidYN="Y">\n                    <LastName>Dzikowiec</LastName>\n                    <ForeName>Magdalena</ForeName>\n                    <Initials>M</Initials>\n                    <AffiliationInfo>\n                        <Affiliation>Department of Biomedicine and Genetics Medical University of Lodz, Pomorska 251, 92-213 Lodz, Poland.</Affiliation>\n                    </AffiliationInfo>\n                </Author>\n            </AuthorList>\n            <Language>eng</Language>\n            <PublicationTypeList>\n                <PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType>\n            </PublicationTypeList>\n        </Article>\n        <MedlineJournalInfo>\n            <Country>England</Country>\n            <MedlineTA>J Water Health</MedlineTA>\n            <NlmUniqueID>101185420</NlmUniqueID>\n            <ISSNLinking>1477-8920</ISSNLinking>\n        </MedlineJournalInfo>\n        <CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset>\n    </MedlineCitation>\n    <PubmedData>\n        <History>\n            <PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez">\n                <Year>2020</Year>\n                <Month>4</Month>\n                <Day>18</Day>\n                <Hour>6</Hour>\n                <Minute>0</Minute>\n            </PubMedPubDate>\n            <PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed">\n                <Year>2020</Year>\n                <Month>4</Month>\n                <Day>18</Day>\n                <Hour>6</Hour>\n                <Minute>0</Minute>\n            </PubMedPubDate>\n            <PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline">\n                <Year>2020</Year>\n                <Month>4</Month>\n                <Day>18</Day>\n                <Hour>6</Hour>\n                <Minute>0</Minute>\n            </PubMedPubDate>\n        </History>\n        <PublicationStatus>ppublish</PublicationStatus>\n        <ArticleIdList>\n            <ArticleId IdType="pubmed">32300087</ArticleId>\n            <ArticleId IdType="pmc">wh_2020_096</ArticleId>\n            <ArticleId IdType="doi">10.2166/wh.2020.096</ArticleId>\n        </ArticleIdList>\n    </PubmedData>\n</PubmedArticle>\n\n</PubmedArticleSet>'
