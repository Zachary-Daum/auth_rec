Yet, the current methods for their assessment are unsuitable for routine use. Post-exercise response of the cardiovascular (CV) system serves as a more sensitive detection of subclinical arterial abnormalities that are not apparent at-rest. The objective of this study is to propose a novel method that can measure post-exercise response of arterial parameters and is also suitable for routine use.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label="APPROACH" NlmCategory="METHODS">A microfluidic tactile sensor with a location-insensitive configuration was used for arterial pulse signal measurements on six asymptomatic male subjects, offering measurement reliability, ease use by a layperson, and affordability. By treating the arterial pulse signal as a vibration signal of the arterial wall, vibration-model-based analysis of only one measured pulse signal with no calibration was conducted for simultaneous estimation of three arterial parameters. Exercise-intensity-normalized percent changes in arterial parameters were utilized to remove the influence of variation in exercise intensity on post-exercise response, and then their measured values were compared for difference in post-exercise response between the subjects.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label="MAIN RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">One subject who was obese, on subject who had insomnia, and the oldest subject in the study demonstrated differences in post-exercise response at the radial artery (RA), as compared with the three subjects free of those three factors. Despite a lack of statistical significance, the observed difference at the RA between subjects was supported by (i) their consistency with the related findings in the literature, and (ii) their consistency with the measured values at the carotid artery (CA) and superficial temporal artery (STA) and the anatomical difference between the three arteries.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label="SIGNIFICANCE" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">The proposed method has the potential of offering an affordable and convenient diagnosis tool for routine arterial health assessment.</AbstractText>\n            </Abstract>\n            <AuthorList CompleteYN="Y">\n                <Author ValidYN="Y">\n                    <LastName>Hao</LastName>\n                    <ForeName>Zhili</ForeName>\n                    <Initials>Z</Initials>\n                    <Identifier Source="ORCID">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2024-1947</Identifier>\n                    <AffiliationInfo>\n                        <Affiliation>Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Old Dominion University, Norfolk, VA, USA. zlhao@odu.edu.</Affiliation>\n                    </AffiliationInfo>\n                </Author>\n                <Author ValidYN="Y">\n                    <LastName>Wang</LastName>\n                    <ForeName>Dan</ForeName>\n                    <Initials>D</Initials>\n                    <AffiliationInfo>\n                        <Affiliation>Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Old Dominion University, Norfolk, VA, USA.</Affiliation>\n                    </AffiliationInfo>\n                </Author>\n                <Author ValidYN="Y">\n                    <LastName>Reynolds</LastName>\n                    <ForeName>Leryn</ForeName>\n                    <Initials>L</Initials>\n                    <AffiliationInfo>\n                        <Affiliation>Department of Human Movement Sciences, Old Dominion University, Norfolk, VA, USA.</Affiliation>\n                    </AffiliationInfo>\n                </Author>\n            </AuthorList>\n            <Language>eng</Language>\n            <PublicationTypeList>\n                <PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType>\n            </PublicationTypeList>\n            <ArticleDate DateType="Electronic">\n                <Year>2020</Year>\n                <Month>01</Month>\n                <Day>30</Day>\n            </ArticleDate>\n        </Article>\n        <MedlineJournalInfo>\n            <Country>United States</Country>\n            <MedlineTA>Cardiovasc Eng Technol</MedlineTA>\n            <NlmUniqueID>101531846</NlmUniqueID>\n            <ISSNLinking>1869-408X</ISSNLinking>\n        </MedlineJournalInfo>\n        <CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset>\n        <KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM">\n            <Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Arterial parameters</Keyword>\n            <Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Arterial pulse signal</Keyword>\n            <Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Arterial stiffness</Keyword>\n            <Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Endothelial function</Keyword>\n            <Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Post-exercise response</Keyword>\n            <Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Subject-specific factors</Keyword>\n            <Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Tactile sensor</Keyword>\n            <Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Vibration-model-based analysis</Keyword>\n        </KeywordList>\n    </MedlineCitation>\n    <PubmedData>\n        <History>\n            <PubMedPubDate PubStatus="received">\n                <Year>2019</Year>\n                <Month>08</Month>\n                <Day>14</Day>\n            </PubMedPubDate>\n            <PubMedPubDate PubStatus="accepted">\n                <Year>2020</Year>\n                <Month>01</Month>\n                <Day>05</Day>\n            </PubMedPubDate>\n            <PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed">\n                <Year>2020</Year>\n                <Month>2</Month>\n                <Day>1</Day>\n                <Hour>6</Hour>\n                <Minute>0</Minute>\n            </PubMedPubDate>\n            <PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline">\n                <Year>2020</Year>\n                <Month>2</Month>\n                <Day>1</Day>\n                <Hour>6</Hour>\n                <Minute>0</Minute>\n            </PubMedPubDate>\n            <PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez">\n                <Year>2020</Year>\n                <Month>2</Month>\n                <Day>1</Day>\n                <Hour>6</Hour>\n                <Minute>0</Minute>\n            </PubMedPubDate>\n        </History>\n        <PublicationStatus>ppublish</PublicationStatus>\n        <ArticleIdList>\n            <ArticleId IdType="pubmed">32002815</ArticleId>\n            <ArticleId IdType="doi">10.1007/s13239-020-00454-2</ArticleId>\n            <ArticleId IdType="pii">10.1007/s13239-020-00454-2</ArticleId>\n        </ArticleIdList>\n    </PubmedData>\n</PubmedArticle>\n\n</PubmedArticleSet>'
