Actually, it is hard to immediately obtain certain wavelengths, deep-ultraviolet coherent light in particular, from commercial laser sources. However, the direct second harmonic generation process governed in part by nonlinear optical crystals is a feasible and effective approach to generate deep-ultraviolet coherent light, which motivates chemists and materials scientists to find potential deep-ultraviolet nonlinear optical materials that can practically meet the scientific requirements. The research progress required to go from a new single-crystal structure to final device applications involves many pivotal steps and is highly time-consuming and challenging, and therefore, it is necessary to commence systematic studies aimed at shortening the research cycle and accelerating the rational design of deep-ultraviolet nonlinear optical materials. In this Account, we choose borates as raw materials because they have ever-greater possibilities to form desired noncentrosymmetric structures, wide optical transparency windows, rich structural chemistry, and also large polarizabilities to guarantee the coexistence of large second-order nonlinear optical coefficients and suitable birefringence. Besides, the effects of fluorine atoms on the structural chemistry and optical properties of borates have been summarized and analyzed. On the basis of these favorable influences, three specific rational design strategies, including experimental and theoretical methods, have been proposed in order to shorten the investigational cycle of discovering the new expected compounds with high physicochemical performances required for practical applications. In this way, the progress of searching for candidates for the next generation of deep-ultraviolet nonlinear optical materials was accelerated from borates to borate fluorides to fluorooxoborates with three effective strategies: (1) expansion of the frontier from borates to borate fluorides with the introduction of fluorine to achieve enhanced optical performance; (2) computer-assisted design of new deep-ultraviolet nonlinear optical materials with a newly introduced systematic global structure optimization method; and (3) expansion of the frontier from borate fluorides to fluorooxoborates by proposed functionalized\xc2\xa0oxyfluoride [BO <sub>x</sub>F<sub>4- x</sub>]<sup>( x+1)-</sup> ( x = 1, 2, 3) chromophores to balance multiple criteria. The preliminary development of fluorooxoborates exhibiting high performance as a new fertile field to search for deep-ultraviolet nonlinear optical materials is highly encouraging and inspiring and can guide chemists and materials scientists with new directions and thoughts aimed at finding the next generation of practical deep-ultraviolet nonlinear optical materials.</AbstractText>\n            </Abstract>\n            <AuthorList CompleteYN="Y">\n                <Author ValidYN="Y">\n                    <LastName>Mutailipu</LastName>\n                    <ForeName>Miriding</ForeName>\n                    <Initials>M</Initials>\n                    <Identifier Source="ORCID">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1331-0185</Identifier>\n                    <AffiliationInfo>\n                        <Affiliation>CAS Key Laboratory of Functional Materials and Devices for Special Environments , Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics &amp;
