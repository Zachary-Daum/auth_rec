In a prospective, cross sectional study, 44 consecutive women with severe or poorly controlled gestational diabetic pregnancies in their third trimester on insulin therapy were recruited and matched with 44 women with normal pregnancies which served as the control group. Using Doppler echocardiography the foetal Mod-MPI was calculated. The foetal Mod-MPI was significantly higher in the diabetic group compared to the controls indicating significant myocardial dysfunction. The Mod-MPI served as an excellent marker of adverse outcomes. Foetal myocardial function was significantly impaired in poorly controlled gestational diabetics and there was a significant link of Mod-MPI to intrauterine markers of hypoxia, as well as to an adverse outcome. Mod-MPI has the potential to improve foetal surveillance in gestational diabetes.IMPACT STATEMENT<b>What is already known on this subject?</b> Abnormal foetal cardiac function, as reflected in the modified myocardial performance index, has been reported to be significantly increased in foetuses of poorly controlled diabetics managed on insulin.<b>What do the results of this study add?</b> There is a significant link between abnormal foetal cardiac function to intrauterine markers of hypoxia, as well as to an adverse outcome; and that development of myocardial dysfunction could be one of the main mechanisms, inducing foetal compromise in poorly controlled gestational diabetes.<b>What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research?</b> This study explores an interesting concept of foetal pathophysiology in gestational diabetes, namely the concept of &quot;pseudo-hypoxia&quot; in a foetus of a gestational diabetic mother, and this intrauterine &quot;hypoxic stress&quot; in turn leading to myocardial dysfunction. The Mod-MPI, a clinical marker for cardiac dysfunction, can therefore be used in the clinical setting to track a deteriorating metabolic state.</AbstractText>\n            </Abstract>\n            <AuthorList CompleteYN="Y">\n                <Author ValidYN="Y">\n                    <LastName>Bhorat</LastName>\n                    <ForeName>Ismail</ForeName>\n                    <Initials>I</Initials>\n                    <AffiliationInfo>\n                        <Affiliation>Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Sub-department of Fetal Medicine, University of Kwa-Zulu Natal, Durban, South Africa.</Affiliation>\n                    </AffiliationInfo>\n                </Author>\n                <Author ValidYN="Y">\n                    <LastName>Foolchand</LastName>\n                    <ForeName>Serantha</ForeName>\n                    <Initials>S</Initials>\n                    <AffiliationInfo>\n                        <Affiliation>Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Sub-department of Fetal Medicine, University of Kwa-Zulu Natal, Durban, South Africa.</Affiliation>\n                    </AffiliationInfo>\n                </Author>\n                <Author ValidYN="Y">\n                    <LastName>Reddy</LastName>\n                    <ForeName>Tarylee</ForeName>\n                    <Initials>T</Initials>\n                    <AffiliationInfo>\n                        <Affiliation>Biostatistics Unit, South African Medical Research Council of South Africa, Durban, South Africa.</Affiliation>\n                    </AffiliationInfo>\n                </Author>\n            </AuthorList>\n            <Language>eng</Language>\n            <PublicationTypeList>\n                <PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType>\n            </PublicationTypeList>\n            <ArticleDate DateType="Electronic">\n                <Year>2020</Year>\n                <Month>03</Month>\n                <Day>09</Day>\n            </ArticleDate>\n        </Article>\n        <MedlineJournalInfo>\n            <Country>England</Country>\n            <MedlineTA>J Obstet Gynaecol</MedlineTA>\n            <NlmUniqueID>8309140</NlmUniqueID>\n            <ISSNLinking>0144-3615</ISSNLinking>\n        </MedlineJournalInfo>\n        <CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset>\n        <KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM">\n            <Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Myocardial performance index</Keyword>\n            <Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">adverse perinatal outcome</Keyword>\n            <Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">cardiac Doppler</Keyword>\n            <Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">foetal hypoxia</Keyword>\n            <Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">gestational diabetes</Keyword>\n        </KeywordList>\n    </MedlineCitation>\n    <PubmedData>\n        <History>\n            <PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez">\n                <Year>2020</Year>\n                <Month>3</Month>\n                <Day>10</Day>\n                <Hour>6</Hour>\n                <Minute>0</Minute>\n            </PubMedPubDate>\n            <PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed">\n                <Year>2020</Year>\n                <Month>3</Month>\n                <Day>10</Day>\n                <Hour>6</Hour>\n                <Minute>0</Minute>\n            </PubMedPubDate>\n            <PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline">\n                <Year>2020</Year>\n                <Month>3</Month>\n                <Day>10</Day>\n                <Hour>6</Hour>\n                <Minute>0</Minute>\n            </PubMedPubDate>\n        </History>\n        <PublicationStatus>aheadofprint</PublicationStatus>\n        <ArticleIdList>\n            <ArticleId IdType="pubmed">32148119</ArticleId>\n            <ArticleId IdType="doi">10.1080/01443615.2019.1710480</ArticleId>\n        </ArticleIdList>\n    </PubmedData>\n</PubmedArticle>\n\n</PubmedArticleSet>'
