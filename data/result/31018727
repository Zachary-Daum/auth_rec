We sought to examine the rate of wound complications in extremely obese women according to postcesarean dressings (NPWT [PICO, Smith &amp; Nephew, St. Peterburg, FL] versus standard dressings).</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label="STUDY DESIGN" NlmCategory="METHODS">This was a retrospective cohort study of all extremely obese women (BMI \xe2\x89\xa5 50\xe2\x80\x89kg/m<sup>2</sup>) at 23 weeks\' gestation or greater who underwent cesarean delivery at an academic teaching hospital in Washington, DC, between January 2009 and September 2017. During this period, a PICO Single Use NPWT system was used at our institution. Women who missed a postpartum follow-up were excluded. Since 2014, Medstar Washington Hospital Center recommended the use of a PICO Single Use NPWT system for extremely obese women at the time of delivery. However, the ultimate decision to use the NPWT was made by attending physicians, considering the cost of the device and the risk of wound complication. Our primary outcome was a composite of cellulitis, hematoma/seroma, and wound dehiscence. Coarsened exact matching with k-to-k solution was performed using BMI, rupture of membranes, and labor.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Of 179 extremely obese women, 73 (40.8%) and 106 (59.2%) received NPWT and standard dressings, respectively; 61 women who received NPWT were matched to 61 women who received standard dressings. The rates of the primary outcome in the unmatched cohort were similar between women who received NPWT and those who received standard dressings (20.6 versus 16.0%; p\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89.44). The rates of primary outcome remained similar between women who received NPWT and those who received standard dressings after matching (18.0 versus 18.0%; p\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x891.00).</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">In extremely obese women undergoing cesarean delivery, prophylactic PICO NPWT was not associated with a decreased risk of the primary outcome compared with standard dressings. A large prospective randomized controlled trial would be useful to answer if NPWT is beneficial for extremely obese women.</AbstractText>\n            </Abstract>\n            <AuthorList CompleteYN="Y">\n                <Author ValidYN="Y">\n                    <LastName>Kawakita</LastName>\n                    <ForeName>Tetsuya</ForeName>\n                    <Initials>T</Initials>\n                    <AffiliationInfo>\n                        <Affiliation>a Obstetrics and Gynecology, Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine , Medstar Washington Hospital Center , Washington , DC , USA.</Affiliation>\n                    </AffiliationInfo>\n                </Author>\n                <Author ValidYN="Y">\n                    <LastName>Iqbal</LastName>\n                    <ForeName>Sara N</ForeName>\n                    <Initials>SN</Initials>\n                    <AffiliationInfo>\n                        <Affiliation>a Obstetrics and Gynecology, Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine , Medstar Washington Hospital Center , Washington , DC , USA.</Affiliation>\n                    </AffiliationInfo>\n                </Author>\n                <Author ValidYN="Y">\n                    <LastName>Overcash</LastName>\n                    <ForeName>Rachael T</ForeName>\n                    <Initials>RT</Initials>\n                    <AffiliationInfo>\n                        <Affiliation>a Obstetrics and Gynecology, Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine , Medstar Washington Hospital Center , Washington , DC , USA.</Affiliation>\n                    </AffiliationInfo>\n                </Author>\n            </AuthorList>\n            <Language>eng</Language>\n            <PublicationTypeList>\n                <PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType>\n            </PublicationTypeList>\n            <ArticleDate DateType="Electronic">\n                <Year>2019</Year>\n                <Month>05</Month>\n                <Day>05</Day>\n            </ArticleDate>\n        </Article>\n        <MedlineJournalInfo>\n            <Country>England</Country>\n            <MedlineTA>J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med</MedlineTA>\n            <NlmUniqueID>101136916</NlmUniqueID>\n            <ISSNLinking>1476-4954</ISSNLinking>\n        </MedlineJournalInfo>\n        <KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM">\n            <Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Cesarean</Keyword>\n            <Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">extreme obesity</Keyword>\n            <Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">negative pressure wound therapy</Keyword>\n            <Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">surgical site infection</Keyword>\n            <Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">wound complication</Keyword>\n        </KeywordList>\n    </MedlineCitation>\n    <PubmedData>\n        <History>\n            <PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed">\n                <Year>2019</Year>\n                <Month>4</Month>\n                <Day>26</Day>\n                <Hour>6</Hour>\n                <Minute>0</Minute>\n            </PubMedPubDate>\n            <PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline">\n                <Year>2019</Year>\n                <Month>4</Month>\n                <Day>26</Day>\n                <Hour>6</Hour>\n                <Minute>0</Minute>\n            </PubMedPubDate>\n            <PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez">\n                <Year>2019</Year>\n                <Month>4</Month>\n                <Day>26</Day>\n                <Hour>6</Hour>\n                <Minute>0</Minute>\n            </PubMedPubDate>\n        </History>\n        <PublicationStatus>aheadofprint</PublicationStatus>\n        <ArticleIdList>\n            <ArticleId IdType="pubmed">31018727</ArticleId>\n            <ArticleId IdType="doi">10.1080/14767058.2019.1611774</ArticleId>\n        </ArticleIdList>\n    </PubmedData>\n</PubmedArticle>\n\n</PubmedArticleSet>'
