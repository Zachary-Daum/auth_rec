After the establishment of the HPH rat model, we detected the right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) and right heart hypertrophy index (RVHI) in HPH rats and controls. The expression levels of miR-593-5p and polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) in rat lungs were detected by quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR). Subsequently, miR-593-5p mimics and inhibitor were constructed and transfected into cells. The proliferation and migration of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) were accessed by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and wound healing assay, respectively. The protein level of PLK1 in PASMCs after transfection with miR-593-5p mimics or inhibitor was detected by Western blot. Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay was conducted to verify the binding condition of miR-593-5p and PLK1. Finally, rescue experiments were performed to explore whether the regulatory effect of miR-593-5p on HPH development was associated with PLK1.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">RVSP and RVHI in rats of the hypoxic group were significantly higher than those of controls. MiR-593-5p was significantly downregulated while PLK1 was remarkably upregulated in lung tissues of HPH rats than those of controls. Similarly, miR-593-5p expression in PASMCs decreased gradually with the prolongation of hypoxia induction. Overexpression of miR-593-5p remarkably inhibited the proliferation and migration of PASMCs. Subsequently, dual-luciferase reporter gene verified the binding condition of miR-593-5p and PLK1. Both the mRNA and protein levels of PLK1 were negatively regulated by miR-593-5p. Also, rescue experiments demonstrated that the inhibitory effects of miR-593-5p on the proliferation and migration of PASMCs could be reversed by PLK1 overexpression.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">MiR-593-5p is lowly expressed in lung tissues of HPH rats. Meanwhile, it stimulates the proliferation and migration of PASMCs via targeting PLK1, thereby promoting HPH development.</AbstractText>\n            </Abstract>\n            <AuthorList CompleteYN="Y">\n                <Author ValidYN="Y">\n                    <LastName>Zhao</LastName>\n                    <ForeName>T-F</ForeName>\n                    <Initials>TF</Initials>\n                    <AffiliationInfo>\n                        <Affiliation>Department of Cardiac surgery, Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.tiefuzhao@163.com.</Affiliation>\n                    </AffiliationInfo>\n                </Author>\n                <Author ValidYN="Y">\n                    <LastName>Wang</LastName>\n                    <ForeName>S-Y</ForeName>\n                    <Initials>SY</Initials>\n                </Author>\n                <Author ValidYN="Y">\n                    <LastName>Zou</LastName>\n                    <ForeName>X-Z</ForeName>\n                    <Initials>XZ</Initials>\n                </Author>\n                <Author ValidYN="Y">\n                    <LastName>Zhao</LastName>\n                    <ForeName>H-D</ForeName>\n                    <Initials>HD</Initials>\n                </Author>\n            </AuthorList>\n            <Language>eng</Language>\n            <PublicationTypeList>\n                <PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType>\n            </PublicationTypeList>\n        </Article>\n        <MedlineJournalInfo>\n            <Country>Italy</Country>\n            <MedlineTA>Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci</MedlineTA>\n            <NlmUniqueID>9717360</NlmUniqueID>\n            <ISSNLinking>1128-3602</ISSNLinking>\n        </MedlineJournalInfo>\n        <CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset>\n    </MedlineCitation>\n    <PubmedData>\n        <History>\n            <PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez">\n                <Year>2019</Year>\n                <Month>5</Month>\n                <Day>14</Day>\n                <Hour>6</Hour>\n                <Minute>0</Minute>\n            </PubMedPubDate>\n            <PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed">\n                <Year>2019</Year>\n                <Month>5</Month>\n                <Day>14</Day>\n                <Hour>6</Hour>\n                <Minute>0</Minute>\n            </PubMedPubDate>\n            <PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline">\n                <Year>2019</Year>\n                <Month>5</Month>\n                <Day>14</Day>\n                <Hour>6</Hour>\n                <Minute>0</Minute>\n            </PubMedPubDate>\n        </History>\n        <PublicationStatus>ppublish</PublicationStatus>\n        <ArticleIdList>\n            <ArticleId IdType="pubmed">31081105</ArticleId>\n            <ArticleId IdType="doi">10.26355/eurrev_201904_17715</ArticleId>\n        </ArticleIdList>\n    </PubmedData>\n</PubmedArticle>\n\n</PubmedArticleSet>'
