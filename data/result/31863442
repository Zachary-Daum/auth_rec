This review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. PubMed and Embase were searched without time restrictions to identify randomized controlled trials comparing\xe2\x80\x89&gt;\xe2\x80\x8912-month P2Y12 inhibition versus \xe2\x89\xa4 12-month treatment in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or stable CAD undergoing PCI. A qualitative assessment was performed using the assessment tool from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health. We performed a meta-analysis of the following endpoints: primary outcome (primarily major cardiovascular events), all-cause death, and major bleeding. Eight trials, comprising 40,218 patients, were included. Five studies were rated &quot;good,&quot; two studies &quot;fair,&quot; and one study &quot;poor.&quot; The meta-analysis showed that\xe2\x80\x89&gt;\xe2\x80\x8912-month P2Y12 inhibition significantly reduced the primary outcomes compared with \xe2\x89\xa4 12-month treatment (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.85; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.75-0.97; <i>p</i>\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.01). No significant difference was demonstrated between groups in all-cause death (HR: 1.02; 95% CI: 0.76-1.36; <i>p</i>\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.91) or major bleedings (HR: 1.26; 95% CI: 0.93-1.70; <i>p</i>\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.14). <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> test showed low to moderate heterogeneity among the included studies (21.6-62.3%). This systematic review and meta-analysis therefore demonstrates a reduction in major cardiovascular events during extended P2Y12-inhibitor treatment beyond 12 months compared with \xe2\x89\xa4 12 months in patients with ACS or stable CAD undergoing PCI. There was no significant difference in all-cause death or major bleedings.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Thieme Medical Publishers 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.</CopyrightInformation>\n            </Abstract>\n            <AuthorList CompleteYN="Y">\n                <Author ValidYN="Y" EqualContrib="N">\n                    <LastName>Larsen</LastName>\n                    <ForeName>Mads Lamm</ForeName>\n                    <Initials>ML</Initials>\n                    <AffiliationInfo>\n                        <Affiliation>Thrombosis and Haemostasis Research Unit, Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.</Affiliation>\n                    </AffiliationInfo>\n                    <AffiliationInfo>\n                        <Affiliation>Department of Cardiology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.</Affiliation>\n                    </AffiliationInfo>\n                    <AffiliationInfo>\n                        <Affiliation>Department of Medicine, Regional Hospital Horsens, Horsens, Denmark.</Affiliation>\n                    </AffiliationInfo>\n                </Author>\n                <Author ValidYN="Y" EqualContrib="N">\n                    <LastName>Grove</LastName>\n                    <ForeName>Erik Lerkevang</ForeName>\n                    <Initials>EL</Initials>\n                    <AffiliationInfo>\n                        <Affiliation>Department of Cardiology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.</Affiliation>\n                    </AffiliationInfo>\n                    <AffiliationInfo>\n                        <Affiliation>Department of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.</Affiliation>\n                    </AffiliationInfo>\n                </Author>\n                <Author ValidYN="Y" EqualContrib="N">\n                    <LastName>Kristensen</LastName>\n                    <ForeName>Steen Dalby</ForeName>\n                    <Initials>SD</Initials>\n                    <AffiliationInfo>\n                        <Affiliation>Department of Cardiology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.</Affiliation>\n                    </AffiliationInfo>\n                    <AffiliationInfo>\n                        <Affiliation>Department of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.</Affiliation>\n                    </AffiliationInfo>\n                </Author>\n                <Author ValidYN="Y" EqualContrib="N">\n                    <LastName>Hvas</LastName>\n                    <ForeName>Anne-Mette</ForeName>\n                    <Initials>AM</Initials>\n                    <AffiliationInfo>\n                        <Affiliation>Thrombosis and Haemostasis Research Unit, Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.</Affiliation>\n                    </AffiliationInfo>\n                    <AffiliationInfo>\n                        <Affiliation>Department of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.</Affiliation>\n                    </AffiliationInfo>\n                </Author>\n            </AuthorList>\n            <Language>eng</Language>\n            <PublicationTypeList>\n                <PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType>\n            </PublicationTypeList>\n            <ArticleDate DateType="Electronic">\n                <Year>2019</Year>\n                <Month>12</Month>\n                <Day>20</Day>\n            </ArticleDate>\n        </Article>\n        <MedlineJournalInfo>\n            <Country>United States</Country>\n            <MedlineTA>Semin Thromb Hemost</MedlineTA>\n            <NlmUniqueID>0431155</NlmUniqueID>\n            <ISSNLinking>0094-6176</ISSNLinking>\n        </MedlineJournalInfo>\n        <CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset>\n        <CoiStatement>A.M.H. reports grants and other from CSL Behring, other from Bristol-Myers Squibb, Bayer, Boehringer-Ingelheim, Astellas, and grants from Octapharma, outside the submitted work.
