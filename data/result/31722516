This study aimed to investigate the risk behaviors of adolescents with T1D and the effect of orthorexic eating behaviors (OEB) on glycemic control (GC).</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label="Methods">This cross-sectional study was conducted with 107 adolescents with T1D who were between 13-18 years of age and attended high school. The risk behavior scale (RBS) and orthorexic behavior scale (ORTO-11) were administered to the participants. A high RBS score indicates risky behavior; a low ORTO-11 score suggests a tendency to OEB. At the same time, participants were tested for GC and categorized as optimal GC (HbA1c \xe2\x89\xa47%) or poor GC (HbA1c &gt;7%).</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label="Results">Among females, those with poor GC had significantly lower ORTO-11 scores than those with optimal GC, which was not the case in males. A significant correlation was found between HbA1c and total RBS, eating habits subscale, and suicidal tendency subscale scores. Participants with poor GC had significantly higher eating habits subscale, alcohol use, and tobacco use subscale scores (p&lt;0.05). Among females, total RBS score, suicidal tendency subscale score was found to be significantly higher in those with poor GC; among males, alcohole subscale score was found to be significantly higher those with poor GC.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label="Conclusions">This study is the first to show the effect of the tendency for OEB on GC among female adolescents with T1D. The study showed that, along with inappropriate eating behaviors, adolescents with T1D should also be assessed for other risk behaviors based on gender to help achieve optimal GC.</AbstractText>\n            </Abstract>\n            <AuthorList CompleteYN="Y">\n                <Author ValidYN="Y">\n                    <LastName>Ta\xc5\x9f</LastName>\n                    <ForeName>Demet</ForeName>\n                    <Initials>D</Initials>\n                    <AffiliationInfo>\n                        <Affiliation>Department of Pediatrics, Ankara City Hospital, Children\'s Hospital, Ankara, Turkey</Affiliation>\n                    </AffiliationInfo>\n                </Author>\n                <Author ValidYN="Y">\n                    <LastName>Mengen</LastName>\n                    <ForeName>Eda</ForeName>\n                    <Initials>E</Initials>\n                    <AffiliationInfo>\n                        <Affiliation>Department of Pediatric Endocrinology, Ankara City Hospital, Children\'s Hospital, Ankara, Turkey</Affiliation>\n                    </AffiliationInfo>\n                </Author>\n                <Author ValidYN="Y">\n                    <LastName>Kocaay</LastName>\n                    <ForeName>P\xc4\xb1nar</ForeName>\n                    <Initials>P</Initials>\n                    <AffiliationInfo>\n                        <Affiliation>Department of Pediatric Endocrinology, Ankara City Hospital, Children\'s Hospital, Ankara, Turkey</Affiliation>\n                    </AffiliationInfo>\n                </Author>\n                <Author ValidYN="Y">\n                    <LastName>U\xc3\xa7akt\xc3\xbcrk</LastName>\n                    <ForeName>Seyit Ahmet</ForeName>\n                    <Initials>SA</Initials>\n                    <AffiliationInfo>\n                        <Affiliation>Department of Pediatric Endocrinology, Ankara City Hospital, Children\'s Hospital, Ankara, Turkey</Affiliation>\n                    </AffiliationInfo>\n                </Author>\n            </AuthorList>\n            <Language>eng</Language>\n            <PublicationTypeList>\n                <PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType>\n            </PublicationTypeList>\n            <ArticleDate DateType="Electronic">\n                <Year>2019</Year>\n                <Month>11</Month>\n                <Day>14</Day>\n            </ArticleDate>\n        </Article>\n        <MedlineJournalInfo>\n            <Country>Turkey</Country>\n            <MedlineTA>J Clin Res Pediatr Endocrinol</MedlineTA>\n            <NlmUniqueID>101519456</NlmUniqueID>\n        </MedlineJournalInfo>\n        <KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM">\n            <Keyword MajorTopicYN="Y">Adolescent</Keyword>\n            <Keyword MajorTopicYN="Y">risk behaviors</Keyword>\n            <Keyword MajorTopicYN="Y">orthorexic eating behavior</Keyword>\n            <Keyword MajorTopicYN="Y">glycemic control</Keyword>\n            <Keyword MajorTopicYN="Y">type-1 diabetes</Keyword>\n        </KeywordList>\n    </MedlineCitation>\n    <PubmedData>\n        <History>\n            <PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez">\n                <Year>2019</Year>\n                <Month>11</Month>\n                <Day>15</Day>\n                <Hour>6</Hour>\n                <Minute>0</Minute>\n            </PubMedPubDate>\n            <PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed">\n                <Year>2019</Year>\n                <Month>11</Month>\n                <Day>15</Day>\n                <Hour>6</Hour>\n                <Minute>0</Minute>\n            </PubMedPubDate>\n            <PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline">\n                <Year>2019</Year>\n                <Month>11</Month>\n                <Day>15</Day>\n                <Hour>6</Hour>\n                <Minute>0</Minute>\n            </PubMedPubDate>\n        </History>\n        <PublicationStatus>aheadofprint</PublicationStatus>\n        <ArticleIdList>\n            <ArticleId IdType="pubmed">31722516</ArticleId>\n            <ArticleId IdType="doi">10.4274/jcrpe.galenos.2019.2019.0128</ArticleId>\n        </ArticleIdList>\n    </PubmedData>\n</PubmedArticle>\n\n</PubmedArticleSet>'
