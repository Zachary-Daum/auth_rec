Sociologists have begun to theorise how these technologies affect and relate; crucial questions for a contemporary sociology of health. This study seeks to contribute to our conceptualisation of how digital health technologies are implicated in health by investigating the motivations, experiences and relations of people using mobile apps for depression or anxiety. We interviewed 14 individuals living in England with a diagnosis of depression or an anxiety disorder, who used smartphone apps as part of self-care. Analysis followed a thematic approach. Three themes were identified. Apps exist within relational contexts - alongside smartphones, beliefs about mental health and other support - which shape app use and lead to an imprecise, casual approach. People engage with apps in a straightforward and uncomplicated manner, leading to immediate symptomatic alleviation, but to limited longer term benefit. The contradiction between the apps\' promise as tools of individual empowerment, with their ability to promote responsibilising frameworks that restrain users\' reflexivity, is central to their implications. Apps can thus contribute to isolation from interpersonal support and promote reductionist biomedical conceptualisations of mental ill health.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>\xc2\xa9 2020 Foundation for the Sociology of Health &amp; Illness.</CopyrightInformation>\n            </Abstract>\n            <AuthorList CompleteYN="Y">\n                <Author ValidYN="Y">\n                    <LastName>Crosby</LastName>\n                    <ForeName>Liam</ForeName>\n                    <Initials>L</Initials>\n                    <Identifier Source="ORCID">https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4643-3701</Identifier>\n                    <AffiliationInfo>\n                        <Affiliation>Institute of Epidemiology and Healthcare, University College London, London, UK.</Affiliation>\n                    </AffiliationInfo>\n                    <AffiliationInfo>\n                        <Affiliation>Faculty of Public Health and Policy, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK.</Affiliation>\n                    </AffiliationInfo>\n                </Author>\n                <Author ValidYN="Y">\n                    <LastName>Bonnington</LastName>\n                    <ForeName>Oliver</ForeName>\n                    <Initials>O</Initials>\n                    <AffiliationInfo>\n                        <Affiliation>Faculty of Public Health and Policy, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK.</Affiliation>\n                    </AffiliationInfo>\n                </Author>\n            </AuthorList>\n            <Language>eng</Language>\n            <GrantList CompleteYN="Y">\n                <Grant>\n                    <GrantID>200309/Z/15/Z</GrantID>\n                    <Acronym>WT_</Acronym>\n                    <Agency>Wellcome Trust</Agency>\n                    <Country>United Kingdom</Country>\n                </Grant>\n            </GrantList>\n            <PublicationTypeList>\n                <PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType>\n            </PublicationTypeList>\n            <ArticleDate DateType="Electronic">\n                <Year>2020</Year>\n                <Month>03</Month>\n                <Day>12</Day>\n            </ArticleDate>\n        </Article>\n        <MedlineJournalInfo>\n            <Country>England</Country>\n            <MedlineTA>Sociol Health Illn</MedlineTA>\n            <NlmUniqueID>8205036</NlmUniqueID>\n            <ISSNLinking>0141-9889</ISSNLinking>\n        </MedlineJournalInfo>\n        <CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset>\n        <KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM">\n            <Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Digital health</Keyword>\n            <Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">digital sociology</Keyword>\n            <Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">e-health</Keyword>\n            <Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">mental health</Keyword>\n            <Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">personal health devices</Keyword>\n        </KeywordList>\n    </MedlineCitation>\n    <PubmedData>\n        <History>\n            <PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed">\n                <Year>2020</Year>\n                <Month>3</Month>\n                <Day>13</Day>\n                <Hour>6</Hour>\n                <Minute>0</Minute>\n            </PubMedPubDate>\n            <PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline">\n                <Year>2020</Year>\n                <Month>3</Month>\n                <Day>13</Day>\n                <Hour>6</Hour>\n                <Minute>0</Minute>\n            </PubMedPubDate>\n            <PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez">\n                <Year>2020</Year>\n                <Month>3</Month>\n                <Day>13</Day>\n                <Hour>6</Hour>\n                <Minute>0</Minute>\n            </PubMedPubDate>\n        </History>\n        <PublicationStatus>ppublish</PublicationStatus>\n        <ArticleIdList>\n            <ArticleId IdType="pubmed">32162706</ArticleId>\n            <ArticleId IdType="doi">10.1111/1467-9566.13076</ArticleId>\n        </ArticleIdList>\n        <ReferenceList>\n            <Title>References</Title>\n            <Reference>\n                <Citation>Aboujaoude, E. and Starcevic, V.
