Seven hundred eighty DEGs were identified which include protein coding genes, miRNAs, and lncRNAs. The enrichment analysis may reveal pathways that these DEGs involved. A total of 383 protein-pairs for DEGs may unfold the possible mechanism how the disease is developed.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label="STUDY DESIGN" NlmCategory="METHODS">This is a clinical basic study on neurofibromatosis type I (NF-1) with spinal deformity.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label="OBJECTIVE" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">The current research focuses on screening key molecules affecting NF-1 with spinal deformity by transcriptome sequencing and discovering its underlying molecular biological mechanisms.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label="SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">NF-1 is a complex multisystem human disorder, which is often found in spinal deformities patients. The success rate of orthopedic surgery for neurofibromatosis type I combined with spinal deformities patients was low because of the lack of molecular pathology.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">In our study, the transcriptome-wide sequencing was preformed to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in this disease.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Seven hundred eighty DEGs were identified which include protein coding genes, miRNAs, and lncRNAs. The DO, GO, KEGG and Reactome enrichment analysis may reveal pathways that these DEGs involved. And the 383 protein-pairs for DEGs that are involved in NF-1 combined with spinal deformities may unfold the possible mechanism how this disease is developed.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">The differentially expressed miRNAs and lncRNAs may contribute the ceRNA network. We focused on three key DEGs: FGFR2, MAP3K1 and STAT4. FGFR2 and MAP3K1 are members of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK-signaling pathway, and STAT4 were involved in the JAK/STAT pathway. The expression changes were verified by other researches and the functional cross-talk between the Ras/MAPK and JAK/STAT pathways may contribute in the disease development. This study took insight of the molecular mechanism of this disease. More detailed interactions between these factors are needed to be further explored. These key DEGs and involved pathways may provide clues in the clinical process for patients with NF-1, especially in prognosis prediction.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label="LEVEL OF
