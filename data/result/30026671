This study was carried out to identify the predictors of organizational commitment among university nursing faculty within Kathmandu Valley, Nepal.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label="Methods" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">A cross-sectional analytical study was conducted based on a sample of 197 nursing faculty selected from 18 nursing colleges affiliated to 5 universities in Kathmandu Valley by using a proportionate stratified random sampling technique. Structured questionnaires regarding socio-demographic information, perceived faculty developmental opportunity, job satisfaction, perceived organizational support, and organizational commitment were used for data collection. Double data entry and data cleaning were done by using Epi-data software; and data analysis was carried out with SPSS version 16 software. Binary regression analysis was used to identify the predictors of organizational commitment and the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) was also calculated.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label="Results" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The findings of this study showed that a majority of respondents had moderate level of organizational commitment (68%) followed by high level (29%) and low level (3%). This study also revealed that the nursing faculty who had a master\'s degree in nursing, a permanent appointment, and job satisfaction had a high level of organizational commitment. On the contrary, this study also revealed that the nursing faculty who were in the position of assistant instructor to assistant lecturer level and more than 5\xc2\xa0years of work experience within same organization were less likely to have a high level of organizational commitment.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label="Conclusions" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Nursing faculty within Kathmandu Valley have a moderate level of organizational commitment. The predictors of organizational commitment are higher education in nursing, position, type of appointment, current organizational tenure, and job satisfaction. Therefore, an organizational authority must pay attention to the modifiable predictors of organizational commitment to enhance organizational commitment of its nursing faculty. This will help to reduce faculty turnover, increase quality of teaching and student\'s satisfaction.</AbstractText>\n            </Abstract>\n            <AuthorList CompleteYN="Y">\n                <Author ValidYN="Y">\n                    <LastName>Timalsina</LastName>\n                    <ForeName>Rekha</ForeName>\n                    <Initials>R</Initials>\n                    <AffiliationInfo>\n                        <Affiliation>Patan Academy of Health Sciences, School of Nursing and Midwifery, Lalitpur Nursing Campus, Lalitpur, Nepal.</Affiliation>\n                    </AffiliationInfo>\n                </Author>\n                <Author ValidYN="Y">\n                    <LastName>K C</LastName>\n                    <ForeName>Sarala</ForeName>\n                    <Initials>S</Initials>\n                    <AffiliationInfo>\n                        <Affiliation>Patan Academy of Health Sciences, School of Nursing and Midwifery, Lalitpur Nursing Campus, Lalitpur, Nepal.</Affiliation>\n                    </AffiliationInfo>\n                </Author>\n                <Author ValidYN="Y">\n                    <LastName>Rai</LastName>\n                    <ForeName>Nilam</ForeName>\n                    <Initials>N</Initials>\n                    <AffiliationInfo>\n                        <Affiliation>Dristi Nepal, Kathmandu, Nepal.</Affiliation>\n                    </AffiliationInfo>\n                </Author>\n                <Author ValidYN="Y">\n                    <LastName>Chhantyal</LastName>\n                    <ForeName>Anita</ForeName>\n                    <Initials>A</Initials>\n                    <AffiliationInfo>\n                        <Affiliation>3Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, Maharajgunj, Kathmandu, Nepal.</Affiliation>\n                        <Identifier Source="ISNI">0000 0004 0635 3456</Identifier>\n                        <Identifier Source="GRID">grid.412809.6</Identifier>\n                    </AffiliationInfo>\n                </Author>\n            </AuthorList>\n            <Language>eng</Language>\n            <PublicationTypeList>\n                <PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType>\n            </PublicationTypeList>\n            <ArticleDate DateType="Electronic">\n                <Year>2018</Year>\n                <Month>07</Month>\n                <Day>16</Day>\n            </ArticleDate>\n        </Article>\n        <MedlineJournalInfo>\n            <Country>England</Country>\n            <MedlineTA>BMC Nurs</MedlineTA>\n            <NlmUniqueID>101088683</NlmUniqueID>\n            <ISSNLinking>1472-6955</ISSNLinking>\n        </MedlineJournalInfo>\n        <KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM">\n            <Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Nursing faculty, organizational commitment</Keyword>\n            <Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Predictors</Keyword>\n        </KeywordList>\n        <CoiStatement>Written permission was taken from the authors for using OCQ and POS.
