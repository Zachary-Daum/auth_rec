Although adverse effects by opioids have been well described, it is unknown whether persistent opioid use is associated with worse survival. Patients who received a lobectomy for stage I NSCLC from 2007 to 2013 were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare database. Opioid use was ascertained through records of prescriptions filled through part D. Patients were matched 2:1 according to their likelihood of persistent opioid use, which was defined as any opioid prescription filled 3 to 6 months after surgery. Two thousand eight hundred eighty-four patients were identified. The incidence of persistent opioid use 3 to 6 months after surgery was 27.0%. After matching, persistent opioid use was associated with worse overall survival (P &lt; 0.001) and cancer-specific survival (P &lt; 0.001). Those who used the lowest quartile of opioids, which was often manifested as a single opioid prescription, showed similar overall survival as no opioid use (HR 1.27, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.93-1.72). However, the second and third quartiles of opioid use were associated with decreased overall survival (HR 1.53, 95% CI 1.14-2.03 and HR 1.39, 95% CI 1.04-1.86, respectively) that was nonetheless less severe than the highest quartile of opioid use (HR 2.50, 95% CI 1.95-3.21). Age, sex, marital status, comorbidity, tumor size, tumor grade, and radiation were also associated with worse overall survival, with chemotherapy use and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery being associated with improved overall survival. Persistent opioid use 3 to 6 months after lobectomy is independently associated with worse overall survival and worse cancer-specific survival.</AbstractText>\n            </Abstract>\n
